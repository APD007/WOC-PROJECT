## Introduction

The cryptographic systems project features a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding
messages through multiple cryptographic methods such as Caesar Cipher, Substituting Cipher,
RSA Encryption, Hill Cipher , Homophonic Cipher and Vigen√®re Cipher. Substitution keys in the Substituting
Cipher are customizable, adding flexibility to encryption. Secure key exchange is facilitated
through the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, ensuring users can confidently engage in confidential
communication. The project prioritizes a seamless user experience with intuitive input and
output options.
